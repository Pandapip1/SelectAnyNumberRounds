[^1]: Pick Any Number is disabled when Draft mode is enabled. It is automatically re-enabled when Draft mode is disabled.

[^2]: Due to an unusual interaction, picking "Distill Acquisition" or "Reroll" results in a softlock. Picking nulled cards also spawns in a card object on the map. We recommend disabling those cards when using this mod.

[^3]: When you pick a card, the timer disappears. However, if the timer runs out, the next player will be able to pick a card, as expected.

[^4]: Reported by user. Tries to create and display endless "BU" cards once continue is picked: ![Provided screenshot](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1095772439172091935/1096163350527881226/image.png)
